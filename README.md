# Titanic
Objective: - To calculate the probability of people who survived the Titanic shipwreck by applying the Ridge Algorithm

Steps:-
1.) Code written in Python for model fitting and then saved the model using the library pickle as 'model.pkl' (File name-Ridge_Titanic)

2.) Code written for flask app where I loaded the fitted model. In the next steps, I defined the app name, and then defined two routes of the app. The first route is the home route that connects to the User Interface. The second route is the predict route where I have done the predictions and stored the probability score as 'results'. (File name-app)

3.) UI written in HTML (File name-UI_Titanic)

4.) Used Java script to access new test data points which is then stored in an array. After that via jQuery Ajax call, I received responses from the FLask App to the UI. (File name-fyh)
